  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>It all started with a desire to change my career .
    I’ve began with learning HTML and CSS on my own which triggered my curiosity and interest in this field. 
    I’ve signed up for Developer Course with Code Nation and from there I took one more step with Cybersecurity Course. During the second course I had the opportunity to apply an apprenticeship job, which it was successful, all thanks to super-supportive teacher and recruiter. I am currently learning in the 12 weeks Master Course through my Apprenticeship scheme , which I enjoy very much.</p>
